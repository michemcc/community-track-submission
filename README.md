# community-track-submission
Community track submission for Codeless Conduct bitcoin bounty

For this submission I will attempt to focus on the below key areas:

 1. Propose a strategy on how would you transition Codeless Conduct into a DAO
 2. Create an onboarding guide for new participants to Codeless Conduct, assuming very little web3 background
 3. For a DAO/community of your choice, map out and define the community values
